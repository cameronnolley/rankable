He looks less like the superhero he‚Äôd made himself into over the course of a roughly six-year rise as singer-songwriter extraordinaire and more like a troubled monarch. <i>Views</i>, which followed two wildly successful projects in 2015 that he‚Äôd branded as mixtapes‚Äî<i>If You‚Äôre Reading This It‚Äôs Too Late</i> and the Future collab <i>What a Time to Be Alive</i>‚Äîwould confirm him as both, his penchant for immaculate songwriting still fully intact and the pressures of existing as the most popular voice in rap, as well as his hometown‚Äôs most successful export, weighing heavy on his mind. <br />\n‚ÄúI made a decision last night that I would die for it,‚Äù Drake raps on ‚Äú9.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust to show the city what it takes to be alive for it.‚Äù Drake‚Äôs presence eclipsed Toronto just about as soon as <i>So Far Gone</i> dropped, but the city‚Äîand what it thinks of him‚Äîwas never far from his mind. There are references here to specific people (‚ÄúRedemption‚Äù), places (‚ÄúWeston Road Flows‚Äù), and experiences (‚ÄúViews‚Äù), along with nods to the influence of the city‚Äôs Caribbean population on ‚ÄúWith You,‚Äù ‚ÄúControlla,‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo Good‚Äù (which just happens to feature Rihanna).<br />\nHe isn‚Äôt too much for the world, though, ruminating on his position as one of music‚Äôs biggest names‚Äîand those who‚Äôd rather he wasn‚Äôt‚Äîon songs like ‚ÄúStill Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHype,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrammys.‚Äù Maybe the the most affecting acknowledgment to this end is the fact that ‚ÄúHotline Bling,‚Äù a strong contender for 2015 song of the summer, was such an afterthought by the time <i>Views</i> was released that it appears here as a bonus track. For all intents and purposes, the Drake of <i>Views</i> is the same one we got on <i>If You‚Äôre Reading This</i> and <i>What a Time</i>, but if his previous proper album (<i>Nothing Was the Same</i>) foretold anything, it‚Äôs that the man peering down from CN Tower sees things differently than the rest of us.",

Working primarily with his longtime collaborator Noah ‚Äú40‚Äù Shebib and a host of invited sonic masterminds, Drake makes songs that say as much through atmosphere as they do with lyrics. Rather than adhere to the conventions of beats and rhymes, his tracks embrace the slippery tension between singing and rapping, between tight rhythms and free-floating passages, between choruses and stream-of-consciousness confessions. <i>Nothing Was the Same</i> is a remarkably unified piece of work, with each song partaking in a singular fusion of sensuality, revelry, and tantalizing darkness.",

Future has been a poster boy for the kind of toxic romantic engagements that turn well-intentioned social media users into self-certified relationship experts since about the time of his split with one-time fianc√©e Ciara. But rather than defend his lifestyle choices in earnest or make a case for himself as misunderstood, he drops an album whose title posits him as either a vindictive lover or a victim of a betrayal. But Future is nobody‚Äôs victim.\n\nWith <i>I NEVER LIKED YOU</i>, he's more likely a master of marketing. The album has far less to do with the rhetoric that surrounds his dating life than it does the MC‚Äôs lifestyle, drawing open the blinds within a single bar of ‚ÄúHOLY GHOST‚Äù: ‚ÄúI was in my big truck, my wrist up, getting my dick sucked.‚Äù The MC sounds as happy as ever across <i>I NEVER LIKED YOU</i>, lamenting only‚Äîin the rare instance that he laments‚Äîa perceived lack of credit for his stylistic influence (‚ÄúI'M DAT N***A,‚Äù ‚ÄúPUFFIN ON ZOOTIEZ‚Äù). There are two instances, however, wherein his influence is wholly undeniable: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM ON ONE‚Äù and ‚ÄúKEEP IT BURNIN,‚Äù where Drake and Kanye West each take a turn paying tribute to one of their most cherished collaborators, rattling off volatile non sequiturs in classic Future style.",
